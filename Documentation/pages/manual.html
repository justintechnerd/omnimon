                <p>If you haven't booted the game yet, go to the Installation section first. Otherwise, congratulations
                    and welcome aboard!
                    Once you have the game running, you will be prompted to pick your first egg.</p>
                <img src="../assets/EggSelection.png" width="240" height="240" alt="" />
                <h3>First Steps</h3>
                <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 20px; position: relative;">
                        <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: #667eea;">1.</span>
                        Navigate around the menu, if you have more than one installed module, move the cursor beyond the
                        avaliable pets to the LEFT or RIGHT to switch module. Choose an egg by pressing A.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 20px; position: relative;">
                        <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: #667eea;">2.</span>
                        Hatching an egg takes around a minute, during this phase, some modules can grant you a permanent
                        status boost by SHAKING the egg a certain amount of times.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 20px; position: relative;">
                        <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: #667eea;">3.</span>
                        Once your first egg hatches, you will hear a sound alert, you will hear it every time a pet
                        needs your attention. Navigate around the menus using UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT buttons and select
                        with A.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 20px; position: relative;">
                        <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: #667eea;">4.</span>
                        Take good care of your pet by feeding, training, and keeping it healthy. The way you care for
                        your pet will influence its evolution path directly, so keep up with its needs!
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 20px; position: relative;">
                        <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: #667eea;">5.</span>
                        The journey is in your hands! Add more eggs, explore, train, and battle with your pet to unlock
                        its full potential.

                                Super Hits (a Mega Hit).
                                The number of Super Hits you achieve depends on your pet's attribute, the color you land
                                on, and the number of shakes performed.
                                If you shake fewer than two times, you will only get 0 or 1 Super Hits.

                                traits from both including flags like Shaken or Traited. There are 3 types of jogress
                                evolutions:

                                    pets into 1. Pet compatibility will be dependent on the pet's name, for example

                                Each pet has a natural sleeping time and will sound an alert when it's time to sleep,
                                keeping a pet awakened past a certain amount of time (defined by the module) will count
                                as a Care Mistake. Pets can be put to sleep out of their natural time without any
                                penalties. Pets will not decrease their "hunger" and "vitamin" values while asleep,
                                but also won't evolve (their evolution timers will keep running). All pets will wake up
                                naturally on their wake up time without the need for intervention. If a pet is put to
                                sleep manually they will still wake up on their own standard wake up time. It is
                                possible to override a pet's sleeping schedule in the Settings Menu. It is possible to
                                wake up a pet by trying to feed them or on training and battling, this will not count as
                                a Care Mistake, but will count as a Sleep Disturbance which is a requirement for
                                certain evolutions. If a pet has it's sleep disturbed, they will fall back asleep after
                                a few minutes. Eggs and recently hatched pets cannot sleep.</p>

                                <li>By accumulation of poops - this will happen when there's 8 poops from a living pet.
                                </li>
                                <li>By fighting in battles - every battle has a chance to cause a pet to get sick, the
                                    chance is usually higher when loosing. Each module has it's own rules.</li>
                                <li>By reaching 99g of weight - if a pet reaches this weight, it will become sick.</li>
                            </ul>
                            When a pet is sick, it will show a skull on the main screen. Pets can be healed by using the
                            Healing option in the menu, some pets may require to be healed more times to be cured. Every
                            time a pet gets sick it increases it's Injury counter, reaching a certain value will trigger
                            a death condition. Leaving pets sick for many hours will too cause a death condition.
                            In some modules, there's the use of "Disturbance Penalty", this increases
                            the chance of getting sick after battle and is applied when a pet is disturbed from sleep.
                            Training successfully decreases the "Disturbance Penalty".</p>

                <p>Modules are a key aspect of Omnimon. They define evolution lines and stats of your pets. You can add
                    and remove modules directly in the modules folder. To enable the training and battle mini-games you
                    need to have at least one active module of a specific ruleset. Dummy and HeadOn require a DMC
                    module. Excite requires a DMX module. Count requires PenC module. It is not necessary to have an
                    active pet of a module type tho. It is not recomended to remove a module while having a pet in the
                    party or box. Updated modules won't reflect the status in an active pet, but will update it's
                    evolution tree.</p>
